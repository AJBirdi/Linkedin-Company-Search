# Linkedin-Company-Search

  

### Note: The LinkedIn Company API is deprecated 

This project was created because I couldn't find a good tool to search companies on LinkedIn so I decided to make my own! 

The idea was to query the LinkedIn Company V1 API to find companies that matched specific parameters such as company size, industry, and geographic location. Unfortunately, the API is deprecated so although I could authenticate my LinkedIn application, my calls to the V1 API failed.
